                <p>Box2D has support for continuous collision. This solves the problem of fast moving objects passing through each other due to discrete time steps. The Box2D continuous collision algorithm uses a time of impact (TOI) collision algorithm along with time sub-stepping for the response.</p>

<p>There are other artifacts due to discrete time steps. Joint limits can also suffer from fast movement. For example, consider a filing cabinet where the drawers use prismatic (slider) joints. A lower and upper limit can be set on a prismatic joint to keep the drawer from going in too deep or pulling out too far.</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/filing_cabinet.svg" alt="filing cabinet"></figure></p>

<p>However, with fast movement the drawer can temporarily end up in a bad state. This can cause a glaring visual glitch. The reason this happens is because with discrete simulation the solver doesn't consider the joint limit <em>until it is violated</em>. Discrete simulation is reactive and it is alway trying to catch up to all the mistakes that have been made (kind of like my life at times).</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/filing_cabinet_broken.svg" alt="joint glitch"></figure></p>

<p>It might be possible to compute the time of impact of the joint on a limit and then use sub-stepping. However, this is quite complicated, especially if there are multiple joints and multiple bodies involved. Admittedly, this is also quite complicated for continuous collision.</p>

<p>Is there a simpler solution? We can draw inspiration from &quot;A Different Approach for Continuous Physics&quot; by Vincent Robert. The idea is to measure the gap between the current position and the limit. This is the position constraint <span  class="math">\(C\)</span>, but in this case the constraint is <em>not</em> being violated yet. However, suppose body velocities are such that the gap is closing. Based on the current position and velocities, I can determine if the limit would be violated once the positions are updated. In that case I can apply an impulse so that the limit is reached but not exceeded.</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/drawer_limits.svg" alt="joint limits"></figure></p>

<p>Here is some math that shows how to use predictive limits. First we have the position constraint <span  class="math">\(C\)</span>. In the case of the prismatic joint the position constraint for the lower limit is:</p>
<pre><code>C = translation - lower_limit</code></pre>
<p>We can use this formula to compute the new position constraint value based on the current position constraint value and the velocity constraint value:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[C_2 = C_1 + \Delta t \dot{C_1}\]</span></p>

<p>The time step is <span  class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> and the velocity constraint value is <span  class="math">\(\dot{C}\)</span>. Normally when the joint limit is active we want <span  class="math">\(\dot{C} >= 0\)</span>, however the formula above implies that what we want:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\dot{C_1} + \frac{C_1}{\Delta t} >= 0\]</span></p>

<p>So in the velocity solver I normally use <span  class="math">\(\dot{C}\)</span> to compute the impulse. Instead I replace <span  class="math">\(\dot{C}\)</span> with <span  class="math">\(\dot{C} + \frac{C}{\Delta t}\)</span>. Simple!</p>

<p>However, there is a special consideration for Box2D. I do not want the velocity solver to deal with position constraint errors because this can add kinetic energy if the position constraint is ever violated. Instead, I have a separate position solver that never modifies the velocity state. So instead I use this in the velocity solver:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\dot{C_1} + \frac{\max (C_1, 0)}{\Delta t}\]</span></p>

<p>This is a very cheap modification to the joint limit solver and it has very nice results. It even simplifies the solver because I don't need to track the limit state for the velocity solver. The downside is that I need two constraints: a lower limit constraint and an upper limit constraint. This is necessary because the velocity constraint value can flip signs in the middle of the solver iterations.</p>

<p>So predictive constraints are proactive and try to anticipate constraint violations before they happen. This works particularly well for some joint limits. We should all try to be more proactive!</p>

<p>I made a recording of the discrete and predictive prismatic joint solvers in Box2D. I reduced the iteration count and used a large time step (30 Hertz) to show the effect well. Also I had to turn off some velocity clamping.</p>
