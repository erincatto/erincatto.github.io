      <description>I received this question on LinkedIn:
I&#39;m working on a 3d dynamic aabb tree based on the concepts of Presson&#39;s bullet contribution. I came across a bullet forum thread in which Dirk recommended looking at your box2d implementation. I noticed the major difference is that box2d is a balanced tree using a surface area heuristic while bullet&#39;s is unbalanced with manhattan distance heuristic.
My guess is that keeping your tree balanced resulted in increased maintenance overhead but decreased tree query times.</description>

      <description>I ran into a problem computing a polygon normal using Newell&#39;s method as described in Christer Ericson&#39;s excellent book Real-Time Collision Detection. In this case the polygon happens to a be a triangle that is close to the origin. So I would guess that Newell&#39;s method would yield a great result. However, this is not true. I only get 2 digits of accuracy in single precision.
Here is the triangle:</description>
