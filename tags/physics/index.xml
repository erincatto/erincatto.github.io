      <description>Box2D has support for continuous collision. This solves the problem of fast moving objects passing through each other due to discrete time steps. The Box2D continuous collision algorithm uses a time of impact (TOI) collision algorithm along with time sub-stepping for the response.&#xA;There are other artifacts due to discrete time steps. Joint limits can also suffer from fast movement. For example, consider a filing cabinet where the drawers use prismatic (slider) joints.</description>
